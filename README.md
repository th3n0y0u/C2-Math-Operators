 ## Assignment Operators
 Used to assign values to variables

 0. Simple Assignment `=`
 1. Addition Assignment `+=`
 2. Subtraction Assignment `-=`
 3. Multiply Assignment `*=`
 4. Divide Assignment `/=`
                      `//=`
5. Modulo Assignment `%=`
6. Exponent Assignment `**=`

### Rule for using Assignment Operators
A variables must be declared before using an assignment operator with variable

*Ex. *

a = 5
a += 2 # equivalent to a = a + 2
